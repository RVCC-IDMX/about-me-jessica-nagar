### The Header
- We created and add our own logo to sit at the top of the website next to the title of our website
- Then we made an easy-to-use menu that is accessible for mobile users through a hamburger menu and to pc or tablet users with large-surface buttons.
- There are links to every section on the webpage
    - bio
    - hobbies
    - gallery
    - blog
    - video
    - contact me

### The Bio
- we were taught how to create an avatar to represent ourselves for the first phase of the project.
- Then we were asked to replace it with a real image of ourselves for the final project.
- I listed my name and the town I am from in the same section as my photo

- I initially wrote basic things about myself that were shown in the example
- Since then I have written more detailed personal things that would be useful in a biography

### The Hobbies
- In this section we were told to come up with a short list of hobbies 
- We learned how to make a bulleted list and format it to our liking

### The Photo Gallery
- In this section we were instructed to take 3 photos that represented our hobbies or interests
    - I decided to take photos of the hobbies I already stated previously
        - reading and drinking tea
        - drawing on my iPad
        - working on coding projects

    
- Once we copied and archived our images to ensure their protection from accidental deletion we began formatting

- We used Squoosh to resize our photos to be 640 pixels wide, then placed them in the image folder to be able to put them in our project

- We then learned how to add a figure, img, and figcaption to our projects
    - each picture was placed into its own figure element, which included the image and the figcaption titles

- We then used the box model to make sure everything was responsive when styling the elements later.

- we used grid and flex to change the layout of the gallery when someone was using a tablet

### The Blog
- Initially this was a space filled with Litlpsum from Sherlock Holmes
- We used this as a holding spot for the final project where we did research and changed the text to the article we created.

- Before the final project we were instructed to style this as we wished with a few rules. 
    - we had to make the font style, color, and size readable
    - make some form of special cap at the beginning of a few paragraphs

- I chose to make the caps stand out but not too much that they did not seem to flow with the rest of the webpage

-

### The Short Video
- We were instructed to make a short 30 second video to put on our website
- I decided to use an old video I had from a high school project 
    - (noted that I should have made a new one)

- We were asked to then create or use an existing YouTube account to upload the video to be able to embed the video in our website

- We then learned how to style an iFrame which I believe was one of the hardest tasks this semester
- I decided to give the video a border and the whole short video element a boarder
- I felt this gave the element continuity with the rest of the website because each section had its own "color scheme" and border

- I overall used the same color scheme throughout the project but used select colors with others to create a feel of seperation of the sections

### Contact Us Form
- First we built the markup for what we needed for the form 
- We then went throught the steps to create a link to our Netlify page to get the input from the form

- We were then asked style the form to make it stand out but all blend with our other elements.
    - We needed to make it easy to navigate and smartphone friendly 
        - which meant big enough fields to use fingers
        - clear enough text to  be able to read on a small screen

### The Footer
- We were instructed to put the copyright mark, the year and our name
- I did simple formating to make it stand out from the rest of the website so it was clear that you have reached the bottom of the page
