            <h2>CSS Image Hover Effects</h2>

            <div class = "blog">

                <p>The main reason web developers use CSS image hover effects is to catch the reader’s attention. If the user has a way to interact with the page as they browser, they are more likely to spend more time on the website. Also, it makes the user experience more intuitive because it shows the user what they can while visiting the website. </p>

                <p>Web developers prefer to use CSS image hover effects over regular animations because animations tend to slow down the website. By using image hover affects you can still have an interactive element without slowing down the website.  </p>

                <p>Here are few examples and descriptions of my favorite ones.</p>

                <p>The first one is the Glitch Effect on Hover by Ryan Yu from Codepen. This effect uses 6 instances of an image to make the glitch effect. After doing some testing, I figured out that you need at least 3 instances of the image to make a single glitch happen. With adding 3 more instances you can have multiple glitches happening at once. </p>

                <p>In the CSS code he has used keyframes to create the glitching effect as well as different types of glitching of the image. There are 3 intense glitch animations and 1 minor glitch animation programmed in the CSS file.</p>
                
                <div class="codepen" data-height="596" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="bvwapv" data-editable="true" data-user="iamryanyu" style="height: 596px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
                    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/iamryanyu/pen/bvwapv">
                    Glitch Effect on Hover</a> by Ryan Yu (<a href="https://codepen.io/iamryanyu">@iamryanyu</a>)
                    on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
                    </div>
                  <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
                

                <p>The second is a Pure CSS Hover Animation by Wifeo from Codepen. This effect has a standard image that when the cursor hovers over it the image becomes brighter, and two texts boxes come from the side with information on them. I found that this could be useful when giving an image a caption or to show a link to someone’s biography, by having their name and job position as the text that is brought on their image. </p>

                <p>In the CSS code he makes the image have a shadow and then when the cursor is hovered over it the shadow goes away, and you can see the image clearly. Also, when you hover over the image, he has the left and right value change of the text to zero so it looks like they are sliding into frame. </p>

                <div class="codepen" data-height="596" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="vEWmpR" data-editable="true" data-user="wifeo" style="height: 596px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
                    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/wifeo/pen/vEWmpR">
                    pure css hover animation css3</a> by Wifeo (<a href="https://codepen.io/wifeo">@wifeo</a>)
                    on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
                    </div>
                  <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                <p>The third is Image Hover Effects Pure CSS by Fall Out Girl from Codepen. This is the effect that I used and added to my gallery. In this example she has made multiple versions of roughly the same concept. I decided to use effect 5 which is the semi-transparent caption that slides up over the original image. </p>

                <p>In the CSS code she made the figcaption (in our case with the gallery) a block that had a fill of a transparent color with the figcaption in white, so it was easy to read over the image. </p>

                <div class="codepen" data-height="596" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="NrrVvz" data-editable="true" data-user="falloutgirl" style="height: 596px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
                    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/falloutgirl/pen/NrrVvz">
                    image hover effects pure css</a> by fall out girl (<a href="https://codepen.io/falloutgirl">@falloutgirl</a>)
                    on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
                    </div>
                  <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                <p>I found all these effects very interesting and would use them while making a website. They all caught my attention and each time I passed that I had to go back to interact with them multiple times just to see how they all worked. I enjoyed learning new way to interact with users other than just menus or links. Overall, I think these are very effective ways to share experiences with the audience.</p>
